# Story 1.8: Mobile Architecture Validation & Cross-Platform Protocol

## Status: Draft
**Priority:** 3 (Future-Proofing)
**Depends On:** Stories 1.1, 1.2 (needs infrastructure and WebSocket protocol)

## Story Statement
**As a** mobile development team,
**I want** validated technical approach for iOS/Android implementation,
**So that** Epic 2 mobile development can proceed without major architectural changes.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ✅ WebSocket protocol validated for mobile network conditions and battery optimization
2. ✅ Effect rendering concepts validated with Metal/OpenGL proof-of-concept examples
3. ✅ Audio processing pipeline assessed for iOS/Android API compatibility and limitations
4. ✅ Performance benchmarks established for cross-platform consistency validation
5. ✅ Shared TypeScript/Swift/Kotlin data models defined and validated
6. ✅ Mobile UI patterns documented for brand consistency and one-handed operation requirements

## Dev Notes

### Epic Context
This story ensures that all architectural decisions made in Epic 1 will work for mobile platforms. It validates assumptions and creates proof-of-concepts to de-risk Epic 2 (Mobile Platform Parity). This prevents major refactoring later.

### Story Dependencies
- **Depends On:** Stories 1.1, 1.2 (core architecture to validate)
- **Informs:** Epic 2 (all mobile stories)
- **Parallel Potential:** Can work alongside Stories 1.3-1.7

### Technical Architecture

#### Mobile Platform Requirements
- **iOS:** Swift 5.9+, iOS 15+, Metal for rendering
- **Android:** Kotlin 1.9+, Android 8+, OpenGL ES 3.0
- **React Native:** Considered but rejected for performance
- **Shared:** TypeScript types via quicktype generation

#### Cross-Platform Protocol
```typescript
// Shared message format for all platforms
interface CrossPlatformMessage {
  version: '1.0';
  platform: 'web' | 'ios' | 'android';
  deviceId: string;
  payload: MessagePayload;
}

// Platform-specific optimizations
interface MobileOptimizations {
  batchMessages: boolean;
  compressPayloads: boolean;
  reducedFrequency: boolean;
  backgroundMode: 'pause' | 'continue' | 'minimal';
}
```
