# Epic 1 Development Plan - Foundation & AI Intelligence with Safety

## Story Overview
- **Total Stories:** 8
- **Parallel Development Candidates:** 5 stories can run concurrently after Story 1.1
- **Sequential Dependencies:** Stories 1.3→1.4 must be sequential

## Dependency Matrix

| Story | Depends On | Blocks | Can Parallel With |
|-------|------------|--------|-------------------|
| **1.1** Project Infrastructure | None | ALL (1.2-1.8) | None - Must complete first |
| **1.2** WebSocket Communication | 1.1 | 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.7 | 1.6, 1.8 |
| **1.3** Google AI Integration | 1.1, 1.2 | 1.4 | 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8 |
| **1.4** AI Intent Classification | 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 | 1.5 | 1.6, 1.7, 1.8 |
| **1.5** Effect Rendering | 1.1, 1.2, 1.4 | 1.7 | 1.3, 1.6, 1.8 |
| **1.6** Safety Controls | 1.1 | None | 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.7, 1.8 |
| **1.7** Control Panel Interface | 1.1, 1.2, 1.5 | None | 1.3, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8 |
| **1.8** Mobile Architecture | 1.1, 1.2 | Epic 2 | 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7 |

## Recommended Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (1 Depot Agent)
**Duration:** ~2-3 days
- **Story 1.1:** Project Infrastructure & Web Control Panel Foundation
- **Critical:** All other stories depend on this

### Phase 2: Core Systems (4-5 Parallel Depot Agents)
**Duration:** ~3-4 days
**Can run in parallel:**
- **Story 1.2:** WebSocket Communication (Agent 1)
- **Story 1.6:** Safety Controls (Agent 2)
- **Story 1.8:** Mobile Architecture Validation (Agent 3)

**After 1.2 completes, add:**
- **Story 1.3:** Google AI Integration (Agent 4)

### Phase 3: AI & Rendering (3-4 Parallel Depot Agents)
**Duration:** ~3-4 days
**Sequential requirement:**
- **Story 1.4:** AI Intent Classification (Agent 1) - Requires 1.3 completion

**Parallel with 1.4:**
- **Story 1.5:** Effect Rendering (Agent 2) - Can start after 1.4 begins
- **Story 1.7:** Control Panel Interface (Agent 3) - Can start after 1.5 begins

## Depot Coordination Strategy

### Optimal Parallel Agent Allocation
- **Max Concurrent Agents:** 5
- **Recommended:** 4 agents for optimal resource usage
- **Peak Parallelization:** Phase 2 with 4-5 agents

### Story Assignment Priority
1. **Critical Path:** 1.1 → 1.2 → 1.3 → 1.4 (Must maintain sequence)
2. **Safety First:** 1.6 can start immediately after 1.1
3. **Early Validation:** 1.8 mobile validation early to catch issues
4. **UI Last:** 1.7 benefits from seeing other components working

### Integration Points
- **After Phase 1:** Basic infrastructure review and testing
- **After Phase 2:** WebSocket and safety system integration test
- **After Phase 3:** Full system integration and E2E testing

## Resource Optimization

### Parallel Execution Benefits
- **Time Savings:** ~40% reduction vs sequential (10 days → 6 days)
- **Agent Utilization:** Average 3.5 agents active throughout
- **Risk Mitigation:** Early detection of integration issues

### Critical Path Protection
- Stories 1.1 → 1.2 → 1.3 → 1.4 form the critical path
- Prioritize these stories for senior developers or additional review
- Monitor these closely for blockers

## Depot Commands for Execution

```bash
# Phase 1: Foundation
/bmad-depot-bridge
*validate-story 1.1
*spawn-dev --story 1.1

# Phase 2: Core Systems (after 1.1 complete)
*validate-story 1.2
*validate-story 1.6
*validate-story 1.8
*coordinate --stories "1.2,1.6,1.8" --max-concurrent 3

# Add Story 1.3 after 1.2 completes
*validate-story 1.3
*spawn-dev --story 1.3

# Phase 3: AI & Rendering (after 1.3 complete)
*validate-story 1.4
*validate-story 1.5
*validate-story 1.7
*coordinate --stories "1.4,1.5,1.7" --max-concurrent 3

# Monitor all sessions
*monitor --continuous
```

## Success Metrics
- [ ] All 8 stories completed within 6-8 days
- [ ] No more than 5 Depot agents active simultaneously
- [ ] Integration tests passing between phases
- [ ] < 10% rework required post-integration
- [ ] All stories meet acceptance criteria

## Risk Mitigation
- **WebSocket Delay:** If 1.2 blocks, safety (1.6) and mobile (1.8) continue
- **AI Pipeline Issues:** Stories 1.5, 1.7 can use mock data if 1.3/1.4 delayed
- **Integration Conflicts:** Daily sync points to catch issues early
- **Resource Constraints:** Prioritize critical path if agent limit reached

## Next Steps
1. Review this plan with team
2. Ensure all stories in `.bmad/stories/` are complete with context
3. Run `/bmad-depot-bridge` to begin coordination
4. Monitor progress via Depot dashboard
5. Daily standup to review integration points
