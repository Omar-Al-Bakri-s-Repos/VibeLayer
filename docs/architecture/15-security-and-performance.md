# 15. Security and Performance

## Security Requirements

**Frontend Security:**
- CSP Headers: `script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data: https:;`
- XSS Prevention: Input sanitization with DOMPurify, React's built-in XSS protection
- Secure Storage: Encrypted localStorage for sensitive data, httpOnly cookies for auth tokens

**Backend Security:**
- Input Validation: Zod schema validation for all API inputs with request size limits
- Rate Limiting: 100 requests/minute per user, 1000 requests/minute per IP
- CORS Policy: Strict origin allowlist for production domains

**Authentication Security:**
- Token Storage: HttpOnly cookies for refresh tokens, memory storage for access tokens
- Session Management: JWT tokens with 15-minute expiry and automatic refresh
- Password Policy: Minimum 8 characters, complexity requirements, breach database checking

## Performance Optimization

**Frontend Performance:**
- Bundle Size Target: <250KB gzipped for initial load
- Loading Strategy: Route-based code splitting, lazy loading for effects library
- Caching Strategy: Service Worker caching for static assets, IndexedDB for effect data

**Backend Performance:**
- Response Time Target: <200ms p95 for API calls, <500ms p95 for AI suggestions
- Database Optimization: Strategic indexing, connection pooling, query optimization
- Caching Strategy: Redis for session data, CDN for static assets, in-memory for effect definitions
