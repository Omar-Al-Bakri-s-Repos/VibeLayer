# 1. Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for **VibeLayerAI**, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## Starter Template Assessment

**Project Type:** Greenfield with custom technology stack

After reviewing the comprehensive PRD and project structure, VibeLayerAI is built as a purpose-designed platform rather than from existing starter templates. The sophisticated requirements - real-time AI processing, cross-platform rendering, sub-500ms latency targets, and mobile-first approach - require custom architectural solutions beyond typical fullstack starters.

The monorepo structure with pnpm workspaces and Turbo aligns with modern fullstack practices while supporting the unique cross-platform needs.
