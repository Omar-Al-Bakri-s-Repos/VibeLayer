# Epic 4: Performance Excellence & ROI Analytics

**Revised Goal:** Achieve realistic performance targets with tiered SLAs while delivering ROI analytics that prove creator value. This epic optimizes system performance within technical constraints while providing comprehensive analytics that justify premium pricing and enable data-driven creator decisions.

## Enhanced Epic 4 Structure (28-38 weeks total):

**Phase 1**: Stories 4.1 + 4.3 (Performance Foundation + Infrastructure) - 8-10 weeks
**Phase 2**: Stories 4.2 + 4.8 (Mobile Optimization + Monitoring) - 6-8 weeks
**Phase 3**: Stories 4.4 + 4.6 (ROI Analytics + AI Optimization) - 10-12 weeks
**Phase 4**: Stories 4.5 + 4.7 (Advanced Analytics + Cost Optimization) - 4-6 weeks

**Revised Performance Targets:**
- **Desktop**: p95 ≤500ms latency, 99.9% uptime, 60fps rendering
- **Mobile**: p95 ≤800ms latency, 99.5% uptime, 30fps minimum/60fps target
- **Cost**: ≤$0.06/hour with quarterly optimization reviews
- **Infrastructure**: $30-55K/month additional investment for performance and analytics systems

## Story 4.1: Latency Optimization & Performance Engineering

**As a** creator who values responsive AI suggestions,
**I want** consistently fast effect suggestions that feel instant and natural,
**so that** VibeLayerAI enhances rather than interrupts my conversation flow.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. End-to-end latency optimization achieves p50 ≤300ms and p95 ≤500ms from speech to UI suggestions
2. Performance telemetry system provides real-time monitoring of all latency components with detailed breakdowns
3. Intelligent caching strategies reduce repeat AI processing costs while maintaining suggestion freshness
4. Network optimization includes regional deployment, CDN usage, and mobile network adaptation
5. Fallback performance modes maintain functionality during high-latency conditions with graceful degradation
6. Performance budgeting system prevents feature additions that violate latency targets
7. Automated performance regression testing catches latency increases during development
