# Next Steps

## UX Expert Prompt

I need comprehensive UX architecture and design system creation for **VibeLayerAI**, a conversation-aware live effects platform for mobile-first creators.

**Critical UX Challenges:**
- **Mobile-first design** with ambidextrous one-handed operation for livestreaming creators
- **Cross-platform consistency** across web PWA, iOS native, and Android native applications
- **Real-time AI suggestion interface** that doesn't interrupt creator flow or audience focus
- **Progressive disclosure** for professional features without overwhelming casual creators
- **Accessibility compliance (WCAG AA)** with outdoor streaming visibility requirements

Please review this PRD and create a comprehensive UX architecture that addresses mobile creator workflows, cross-platform design consistency, and the unique challenges of real-time AI-assisted content creation.

## Architect Prompt

I need detailed technical architecture design for **VibeLayerAI** based on this comprehensive PRD.

**Critical Architecture Challenges:**
- **Real-time AI pipeline** achieving realistic latency targets: Desktop p95 ≤500ms, Mobile p95 ≤800ms
- **Cross-platform rendering consistency** using WebGL (web), Metal (iOS), and OpenGL/Vulkan (Android)
- **Mobile performance optimization** with thermal management and battery efficiency
- **Scalable infrastructure** supporting thousands of concurrent creators with WebSocket connections
- **Enterprise-grade security** with compliance requirements and comprehensive audit trails

Please create a detailed system architecture that addresses these constraints while providing realistic implementation guidance for the 4-phase development approach.
