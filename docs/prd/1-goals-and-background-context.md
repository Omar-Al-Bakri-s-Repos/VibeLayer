# 1. Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Enable real-time, conversation-aware visual effects that maintain creator flow during livestreams
- Achieve mobile feature parity including native RTMP streaming, overlay rendering, and full AI capabilities with sub-500ms suggestion latency
- Deliver automated engagement tools with measurable ROI demonstration within first week of usage
- Maintain <500ms latency despite network variability through intelligent fallbacks and caching
- Achieve 60% monthly active usage after initial activation
- Provide enterprise-grade privacy controls with prominent panic functionality

## Background Context
**VibeLayerAI** addresses the critical income gap affecting mobile-first livestream creators. With 70%+ of live content creation now happening on mobile platforms, creators lack access to professional overlay tools that desktop streamers use to achieve 15-30% higher donation rates during visually engaging streams. The core problem isn't just technical limitationâ€”it's the impossible multitasking burden of manual effect triggering while maintaining authentic audience connection on mobile devices.

Current solutions require desktop setups and break creator flow through manual operation, missing the ephemeral moments that drive viewer engagement and creator income. With real-time AI processing costs dropping 80% and mobile hardware (A15+/Snapdragon 8 Gen1+) now capable of professional-quality rendering, the opportunity exists to democratize conversation-aware effects for the fastest-growing creator segment.

The platform's Google-exclusive AI stack and agentic orchestration enable deterministic effect rendering while maintaining the sub-500ms latency critical for natural conversation flow. This positions VibeLayerAI as the first mobile-native solution that proves ROI correlation rather than just providing entertainment value.
