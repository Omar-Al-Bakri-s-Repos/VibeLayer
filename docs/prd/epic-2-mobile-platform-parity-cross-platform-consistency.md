# Epic 2: Mobile Platform Parity & Cross-Platform Consistency

**Restructured Goal:** Launch native mobile apps for iOS and Android with realistic performance targets and broader device compatibility. Achieve functional parity with adaptive quality management, ensuring professional creator experience while acknowledging mobile platform constraints and app store compliance requirements.

## Epic 2A: Mobile Foundation & Core Functionality (6-8 weeks)

**Stories 2.1-2.3**: Platform foundation with expanded hardware support (A13+/Snapdragon 855+ equivalent), basic audio processing with mobile-optimized latency targets (p95 <1000ms), and simplified UI optimized for mobile constraints and app store policy compliance.

## Epic 2B: Mobile AI & Rendering Excellence (8-10 weeks)

**Stories 2.4-2.5**: Advanced AI processing with thermal management, rendering with 30fps target and adaptive performance, cross-platform consistency with acceptable variance tolerance for mobile hardware limitations.

## Epic 2C: Mobile Streaming & Professional Integration (4-6 weeks)

**Stories 2.6-2.8**: RTMP integration with platform-specific implementations, comprehensive safety controls, and cross-platform synchronization with offline capability and conflict resolution.

## Story 2.1: iOS Native App Foundation & Authentication

**As a** mobile iOS creator,
**I want** a native iOS app that integrates with my existing VibeLayerAI account,
**so that** I can use conversation-aware effects while streaming from my phone.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Native iOS app (Swift/SwiftUI) with minimum iOS 16 support and A13+ optimization
2. Seamless authentication using existing web account credentials with biometric login support
3. Microphone and camera permission handling with clear privacy explanations
4. Background processing capabilities configured for continuous AI processing during streams
5. iOS Human Interface Guidelines compliance with accessibility features (VoiceOver, Dynamic Type)
6. App Store submission preparation with privacy policy and required permissions documentation

## Story 2.2: Android Native App Foundation & Authentication

**As a** mobile Android creator,
**I want** a native Android app with the same capabilities as iOS,
**so that** I can use VibeLayerAI regardless of my device choice.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Native Android app (Kotlin/Jetpack Compose) with minimum API 31 and Snapdragon 855+ optimization
2. Authentication parity with iOS including biometric support and account synchronization
3. Permission handling following Android best practices with runtime permission requests
4. Background processing with foreground service for continuous operation during streams
5. Material Design 3 compliance with comprehensive accessibility support (TalkBack, large text)
6. Google Play Store submission preparation with data safety declarations

## Story 2.3: Cross-Platform Mobile UI & One-Handed Operation

**As a** mobile creator,
**I want** an interface optimized for one-handed operation during streaming,
**so that** I can manage effects without interrupting my content creation flow.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Stream Control Hub with thumb-reach optimization and left/right orientation detection
2. Ambidextrous design automatically adapts to dominant hand preference with UI mirroring
3. Large touch targets (48px minimum) validated across hand-size demographics
4. Glanceable status indicators comprehensible within 2 seconds of peripheral vision
5. Voice command integration for basic navigation and panic controls
6. Outdoor streaming mode with high contrast and specialized brightness optimization
