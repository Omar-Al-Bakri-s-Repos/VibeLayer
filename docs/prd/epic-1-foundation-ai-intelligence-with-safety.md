# Epic 1: Foundation & AI Intelligence with Safety

**Expanded Goal:** Establish the core conversation-aware AI intelligence that differentiates VibeLayerAI while providing immediate value through web-based effects and essential safety controls. This epic validates the most critical technical assumptions and delivers deployable functionality for desktop streamers while preparing the foundation for mobile expansion.

## Story 1.1: Project Infrastructure & Web Control Panel Foundation

**As a** development team and creator,
**I want** comprehensive project setup with immediate creator interface,
**so that** creators can access the system while we maintain development efficiency.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. pnpm workspace monorepo configured with mobile architecture planning documentation
2. Next.js 15 control panel with basic creator signup, authentication, and microphone permissions
3. Shared packages with mobile compatibility: effects-engine, protocol, brand-kit, config
4. CI/CD pipeline with performance profiling infrastructure and mobile testing preparation
5. Security framework (Doppler, CSP, SRI) with mobile app security requirements documented
6. Basic creator dashboard with system status and connection indicators

## Story 1.2: WebSocket Communication & Real-Time Foundation

**As a** creator,
**I want** instant system responsiveness without page refreshes,
**so that** I can maintain focus on my audience while managing effects seamlessly.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Node.js/Fastify WebSocket hub with JWT authentication and mobile network optimization
2. Connection resilience tested with 10-second network interruptions and automatic recovery
3. Message protocol designed for mobile constraints with binary optimization where needed
4. Performance telemetry collection for latency, reliability, and mobile-relevant metrics
5. Multi-session support with at-least-once delivery guarantees and duplicate detection
6. WebSocket scaling validation supports target concurrent user loads

## Story 1.3: Google AI Integration & Speech Processing

**As a** creator,
**I want** the system to listen to my conversation and understand what's happening,
**so that** relevant effects can be suggested automatically during my stream.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Google Cloud STT v2 integration with streaming capabilities and voice activity detection
2. Speaker diarization distinguishes between host and guests with unique identifiers
3. Music/speech separation prevents background music from triggering false suggestions
4. Audio stream encryption implemented for privacy protection
5. Basic audio processing achieves <300ms STT latency on stable network connections
6. Transcript confidence scoring provides reliability metrics for downstream processing

## Story 1.4: AI Intent Classification Engine

**As a** creator,
**I want** the AI to recognize exciting moments, celebrations, and emotional peaks in my conversation,
**so that** appropriate visual effects can be suggested at the right times.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Gemini 2.5 Flash integration classifies intents: celebration, wins, losses, gratitude, hype, romance
2. Intent confidence scoring with threshold controls for suggestion quality
3. Context window management prevents duplicate suggestions for similar phrases
4. Intent classification achieves target accuracy >85% on test dataset
5. Sensitive content filtering prevents inappropriate auto-suggestions
6. Agent orchestration via LangGraph coordinates STT → Intent → Suggestion pipeline

## Story 1.5: Basic Effect Rendering & Web Overlay System

**As a** desktop streamer,
**I want** visual effects to render smoothly in my streaming software,
**so that** I can enhance my stream with conversation-aware visuals.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WebGL-based effect rendering engine with Lottie integration for complex animations
2. Premultiplied alpha support ensures proper compositing in OBS/streaming software
3. Effect library with 5-10 foundational effects covering core intent categories
4. Deterministic rendering with identical seeds produces consistent visual output
5. Performance monitoring achieves 60fps target with graceful degradation to 30fps
6. Signed overlay URLs with JWT tokens prevent unauthorized access

## Story 1.6: Essential Safety Controls & Emergency Systems

**As a** creator,
**I want** immediate control to stop all effects if something goes wrong,
**so that** I can maintain professional stream quality and handle unexpected situations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Prominent panic button in control panel stops all active effects within 200ms
2. Hotkey support (configurable, default: Ctrl+Shift+P) for panic activation
3. 10-second effect lockout period after panic activation prevents immediate retriggering
4. Undo functionality available for 5 seconds after panic or manual activation
5. Effect pause/resume controls for temporary deactivation without full panic
6. Visual feedback confirms panic activation and system status clearly

## Story 1.7: Control Panel Core Interface

**As a** creator,
**I want** an intuitive web interface to monitor suggestions, manage effects, and control settings,
**so that** I can operate the system efficiently while streaming.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Live suggestion queue displays AI recommendations with confidence indicators
2. Manual effect library with instant search and category filtering
3. Basic settings panel for audio thresholds and auto-trigger controls
4. Effect activation history with timestamps and source tracking (auto vs manual)
5. System status indicators show AI pipeline health and connection status
6. Mobile-responsive design preparing for future mobile app consistency

## Story 1.8: Mobile Architecture Validation & Cross-Platform Protocol

**As a** mobile development team,
**I want** validated technical approach for iOS/Android implementation,
**so that** Epic 2 mobile development can proceed without major architectural changes.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WebSocket protocol validated for mobile network conditions and battery optimization
2. Effect rendering concepts validated with Metal/OpenGL proof-of-concept examples
3. Audio processing pipeline assessed for iOS/Android API compatibility and limitations
4. Performance benchmarks established for cross-platform consistency validation
5. Shared TypeScript/Swift/Kotlin data models defined and validated
6. Mobile UI patterns documented for brand consistency and one-handed operation requirements
