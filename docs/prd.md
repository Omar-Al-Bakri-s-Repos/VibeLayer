## 1. Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Enable real-time, conversation-aware visual effects that maintain creator flow during livestreams
- Achieve mobile feature parity including native RTMP streaming, overlay rendering, and full AI capabilities with sub-500ms suggestion latency
- Deliver automated engagement tools with measurable ROI demonstration within first week of usage
- Maintain <500ms latency despite network variability through intelligent fallbacks and caching
- Achieve 60% monthly active usage after initial activation
- Provide enterprise-grade privacy controls with prominent panic functionality

### Background Context
**VibeLayerAI** addresses the critical income gap affecting mobile-first livestream creators. With 70%+ of live content creation now happening on mobile platforms, creators lack access to professional overlay tools that desktop streamers use to achieve 15-30% higher donation rates during visually engaging streams. The core problem isn't just technical limitation—it's the impossible multitasking burden of manual effect triggering while maintaining authentic audience connection on mobile devices.

Current solutions require desktop setups and break creator flow through manual operation, missing the ephemeral moments that drive viewer engagement and creator income. With real-time AI processing costs dropping 80% and mobile hardware (A15+/Snapdragon 8 Gen1+) now capable of professional-quality rendering, the opportunity exists to democratize conversation-aware effects for the fastest-growing creator segment.

The platform's Google-exclusive AI stack and agentic orchestration enable deterministic effect rendering while maintaining the sub-500ms latency critical for natural conversation flow. This positions VibeLayerAI as the first mobile-native solution that proves ROI correlation rather than just providing entertainment value.

## 3. User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
**Mobile-First Creator Empowerment with Adaptive Intelligence**: Create an interface that allows creators to focus entirely on audience engagement while sophisticated AI and effects work transparently in the background. The experience should feel like having a professional production assistant who anticipates needs, never interrupts creative flow, and gracefully handles technical complexity through progressive disclosure.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Ambidextrous One-Handed Operation**: All critical functions accessible within thumb reach with automatic left/right orientation detection and UI mirroring
- **Glanceable Information**: Status indicators comprehensible within 2 seconds of peripheral vision glance without requiring focus shift from audience
- **Panic-First Safety**: Emergency controls prominently positioned but anxiety-neutral design, always accessible regardless of app state with <200ms response guarantee
- **Contextual Progressive Disclosure**: AI suggestions primary interface with manual fallback always visible; advanced features emerge based on creator behavior patterns
- **Thermal-Aware Adaptation**: UI automatically adjusts complexity and communicates performance trade-offs when device thermal limits approached

### Core Screens and Views
- **Stream Control Hub**: Primary mobile interface combining live effect queue, prominent panic control, and battery/thermal indicators in adaptive thumb-optimized layout
- **Effect Library Browser**: Always-accessible manual fallback with instant search, performance cost indicators, and AI relevance scoring
- **Analytics Dashboard (Phase 2)**: ROI correlation visualization with confidence scoring - deferred to validate core value proposition first
- **Settings & Permissions**: Streamlined configuration emphasizing zero-config success with progressive customization unlock
- **Brand Kit Manager (Phase 2)**: Visual customization tools available after core functionality proven with creators

### Accessibility: WCAG AA + Creator-Specific Enhancements

- Large touch targets (48px minimum) validated across hand-size demographics
- Screen reader support with creator-focused audio descriptions
- Keyboard navigation for desktop control panel users
- Voice command integration for panic controls and basic navigation
- Reduced motion options with seizure prevention safeguards

### Branding
**Conversation-Aware Aesthetic with Trust Indicators**: Visual design reflects AI intelligence through subtle micro-interactions that mirror speech energy and confidence levels. Color palette emphasizes creator trust (deep blues) with excitement accents (customizable highlights). Battery and thermal states communicated through progressive color shifts rather than intrusive alerts.

### Target Device and Platforms: Native Mobile + Web Responsive
- **Primary**: iOS native app (A15+ devices) with Metal-accelerated rendering and seamless thermal management
- **Secondary**: Android native app (Snapdragon 8 Gen1+ equivalent) with OpenGL/Vulkan rendering and manufacturer-specific thermal profiles
- **Tertiary**: Web PWA for desktop streamers with feature parity where technically feasible
- **Cross-platform consistency**: Shared design system with automated consistency validation and platform-optimized implementations
