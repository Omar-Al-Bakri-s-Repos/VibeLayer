# VibeLayer ScrumMaster - Depot Integration Configuration

ACTIVATION-NOTICE: This configuration extends the existing BMAD ScrumMaster agent for VibeLayer project with comprehensive story backlog generation.

CRITICAL: This configuration should be loaded by the ScrumMaster agent when working on VibeLayer project to enable full story backlog output for Depot integration.

## VIBELAYER STORY GENERATION CONFIGURATION

```yaml
project_specific_config:
  project_name: "VibeLayer"
  project_type: "AI-powered visual effects platform"
  target_platform: "Web, Mobile (Android/iOS)"

  # When activated, ScrumMaster generates complete application backlog
  comprehensive_backlog: true
  story_output_location: ".bmad/stories/"
  story_naming_pattern: "story_{feature}_{priority}.md"

## COMPREHENSIVE STORY GENERATION TASK

When *generate-full-backlog command is invoked:

### Step 1: Initialize VibeLayer Context
- Load VibeLayer project structure from monorepo
- Review existing packages and their purposes
- Understand current architecture and technology choices

### Step 2: Generate Feature Stories
For each feature in vibelayer_features:
- Create detailed story with full implementation context
- Include architecture guidance specific to VibeLayer patterns
- Specify package locations and dependencies
- Add testing requirements for TypeScript/React environment

### Step 3: Generate Technical Stories  
For each technical component:
- Create infrastructure and tooling stories
- Include build system and deployment considerations
- Specify integration patterns between packages

### Step 4: Add Story Dependencies
- Map dependencies between feature stories
- Ensure logical development order
- Mark stories that can be developed in parallel

### Step 5: Output Complete Backlog
- Write all stories to .bmad/stories/ directory
- Use consistent naming: story_{feature}_{priority}.md
- Include comprehensive context in each story file
- Generate dependency matrix for coordination

## STORY TEMPLATE ENHANCEMENTS

Each generated story should include:

```markdown
# Story: {Feature Name}

## Context
{Business context specific to VibeLayer platform}

## Implementation Details
{Technical approach using VibeLayer tech stack}
- Package: @vibelayer/{relevant-package}
- Technology: {TypeScript/React/Next.js/etc}
- Files to create/modify: {specific file paths}

## Architecture Guidance  
{Relevant VibeLayer architecture decisions and patterns}
- Monorepo structure considerations
- Package interdependencies
- API communication patterns

## Acceptance Criteria
{Clear, testable success criteria}

## Testing Requirements
{Testing approach for VibeLayer environment}
- Unit tests with Jest/Vitest
- Integration tests
- E2E tests with Playwright

## Dependencies
{Other stories that must be completed first}

## Priority
{P1/P2/P3/P4 based on VibeLayer roadmap}
```
