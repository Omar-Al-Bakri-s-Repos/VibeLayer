## Industry Analysis

### Porter's Five Forces Assessment

#### Supplier Power: Medium
Google/OpenAI control core AI infrastructure, but multiple model providers emerging. Cloud computing costs decreasing, but specialized AI chips create some dependency. **Implication:** Build vendor-agnostic architecture early.

#### Buyer Power: Medium-High  
Creators have many free alternatives, low switching costs, price-sensitive especially in casual segments. Network effects within creator communities amplify recommendations. **Implication:** Focus on clear ROI demonstration and viral adoption mechanics.

#### Competitive Rivalry: Low-Medium

Moderate technical barriers (real-time AI), but well-funded startups could enter quickly. Platform risk of native feature development. **Implication:** Speed to market critical, build defensible creator relationships.

#### Threat of Substitutes: Medium
Manual effects, post-production editing, platform native tools provide alternative solutions. Creator time/attention is substitutable across different production approaches. **Implication:** Position as time-saving and unique vs. all alternatives.

### Technology Adoption Lifecycle Stage
**Current Stage:** Early Majority (crossing the chasm from early adopters)
